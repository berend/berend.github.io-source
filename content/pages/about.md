My name is Berend Kapelle and I am a developer located in Hamburg/Germany. Currently my main interest is doing
data analytics with the help of the python eco system. This blog is mainly about crafting code around data.

I started programming at the age of 12 with a commodore 64. Later I studied information sciences at the [Technical University
Hamburg-Harburg](https://www.tuhh.de/) and finished as graduate engineer. I am also active in the Handelskammer Hamburg
graduating new developer apprentices.

Currently I work in the fintech industry at [figo](https://www.figo.io).
