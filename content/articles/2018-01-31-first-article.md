Title: Some words about this blog

Welcome to this blog! This post is about why and how.


## Why?

I like learning new stuff. In my opinion learning works best if you can teach or describe what you learnt to others.
This is what I try to do here.


## How?

As you have probably noticed this blog ist hosted on github pages. This is completely free!
Since github only serves static webpages, I use one of the many static page generators:
[Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/]). I choose Pelican, because it has a good Jupyter Notebook
integration. That allows me to explore topics and create blog entries at the same time.

If you want the details, the source for these websites is a github repo (a prerequisite for hosting it on github)

The repo that hold the source files tht pelican turns into static web pages, can be found [here](https://www.github.com/berend/berend.github.io-source).
If you find any errors or have comments, enhancements or tips, issues or pull requests are very welcome in this repo.
